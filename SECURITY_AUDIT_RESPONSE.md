# Security Audit Response - Immediate Actions Required

## Executive Summary

**Good News:** After investigation, `.env.local` was **NEVER committed to Git**. It exists locally but is properly ignored by `.gitignore`. No secrets have been exposed in the repository history.

**However**, the local `.env.local` file still contains production-capable secrets, which poses a risk if:
- Your machine is compromised
- The file is accidentally committed in the future
- Team members copy the file to other projects

## Current Status: ✅ LOW RISK (No Git Exposure)

The audit correctly identified potential security issues, but the actual risk level is lower than initially assessed because:

1. ✅ `.env.local` is properly in `.gitignore`
2. ✅ No secrets found in Git history
3. ✅ `.env.example` exists with placeholders
4. ⚠️ BUT: Local `.env.local` contains real secrets (normal for development)

## Immediate Actions Required

### PRIORITY 1: Preventive Measures (Do This Today)

Even though secrets weren't exposed, implement these safeguards now:

#### 1.1 Review and Understand Documentation
```bash
# Read the comprehensive guides created:
cat .claude/docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
cat .claude/docs/CI_SECURITY_SAFEGUARDS.md
```

#### 1.2 Set Up Pre-commit Hooks (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install Husky
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky init

# Create pre-commit hook
cat > .husky/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh

# Check for .env.local in staging area
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "\.env\.local"; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Attempting to commit .env.local"
  echo "This file contains secrets and should never be committed."
  echo "Run: git reset HEAD .env.local"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for hardcoded secrets in staged files
if git diff --cached -p | grep -iE "(sk_test_|sk_live_|AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{35})" -- "*.ts" "*.tsx" "*.js" "*.jsx"; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Hardcoded secret detected in staged files"
  echo "Remove secrets from code and use environment variables instead."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit security checks passed"
EOF

chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

#### 1.3 Enable GitHub Secret Scanning (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://github.com/seanchiuai/hands-off-your-keyboard/settings/security_analysis
2. Enable "Secret scanning"
3. Enable "Push protection"

#### 1.4 Add GitHub Actions Security Workflow (3 minutes)
```bash
# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy the security scan workflow
# See .claude/docs/CI_SECURITY_SAFEGUARDS.md for the full workflow content
```

### PRIORITY 2: Best Practices (Do This Week)

#### 2.1 Review Current Secrets

Your `.env.local` currently contains:
- ✅ Clerk test keys (`pk_test_*`, `sk_test_*`) - Appropriate for development
- ✅ Convex development deployment (`dev:*`) - Correct
- ⚠️ Google Gemini API key - Verify this has usage limits/alerts
- ⚠️ SerpAPI key - Verify rate limits are set
- ⚠️ Pipecat server secret - Ensure it matches `pipecat/.env`

**Actions:**
1. **Google Gemini API:**
   - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Set usage quotas (e.g., 100 requests/day for dev)
   - Enable billing alerts

2. **SerpAPI:**
   - Go to https://serpapi.com/dashboard
   - Verify free tier limits (100 searches/month)
   - Enable usage alerts

3. **Pipecat Secret:**
   ```bash
   # Verify both files have the same secret
   grep PIPECAT_SERVER_SECRET .env.local
   grep PIPECAT_SERVER_SECRET pipecat/.env
   # These should match
   ```

#### 2.2 Prepare for Production Deployment

When you deploy to production:

**Do NOT use `.env.local` in production.** Instead:

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each secret individually
3. Mark sensitive values as "Secret"
4. Use PRODUCTION Clerk keys (not test keys)

**For Convex Production:**
```bash
# Deploy to production
npx convex deploy --prod

# Set production environment variables
npx convex env set CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN "your-production-domain.com" --prod
```

**For Clerk Production:**
1. Create separate Clerk application for production
2. Use `pk_live_*` and `sk_live_*` keys
3. Set up production JWT template

### PRIORITY 3: Team Education (Ongoing)

#### 3.1 Share Security Documentation

Share these documents with your team:
- `.env.example` - Template for environment setup
- `.claude/docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `.claude/docs/CI_SECURITY_SAFEGUARDS.md` - Security best practices

#### 3.2 Security Principles

Reinforce these principles:
1. **NEVER** commit `.env.local` to Git
2. **ALWAYS** use `.env.example` for documentation
3. **SEPARATE** development and production secrets
4. **ROTATE** keys if exposure is suspected
5. **MONITOR** third-party API usage

## What Was Done

### ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Enhanced `.env.example`**
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Included setup instructions for all services
   - Added security reminders
   - Documented environment separation

2. **Verified `.gitignore`**
   - Confirmed `.env*` is properly ignored
   - Verified `.env.local` was never committed
   - No action needed (already correct)

3. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**
   - `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Complete guide for environment setup, key rotation, and troubleshooting
   - `CI_SECURITY_SAFEGUARDS.md` - Pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, ESLint rules, and secret scanning

4. **Verified Git History**
   - Scanned Git history for `.env.local`
   - Confirmed no secrets in repository
   - No cleanup needed

## Key Rotation Decision

### Do You Need to Rotate Keys?

**SHORT ANSWER: Probably not, but consider it for peace of mind.**

**Detailed Assessment:**

| Secret | Exposed in Git? | Should Rotate? | Reason |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Clerk Keys | ❌ No | ⚠️ Optional | Test keys only; low risk |
| Convex Deployment | ❌ No | ❌ No | Dev deployment; no security impact |
| Google Gemini API | ❌ No | ⚠️ Optional | If shared machine or concerned about access |
| SerpAPI Key | ❌ No | ⚠️ Optional | Limited free tier; low financial risk |
| Pipecat Secret | ❌ No | ⚠️ Optional | Only if shared outside team |

**When to Rotate:**
- If you've shared your computer with untrusted users
- If you've accidentally pasted secrets in chat/email
- If you're concerned about unauthorized access
- If required by compliance/security policy
- As a scheduled practice (recommended every 90 days)

**When NOT to Rotate:**
- Just because secrets exist locally (this is normal)
- If you're certain the machine is secure
- If all secrets are development/test keys only

## Questions?

### Q: Should I delete my `.env.local` file?
**A:** No! You need it for development. Just keep it local and never commit it.

### Q: Are my secrets compromised?
**A:** No. They were never committed to Git. If your machine is secure, your secrets are safe.

### Q: Should I rotate my keys now?
**A:** Optional. See "Key Rotation Decision" section above. If concerned, follow the rotation guide in `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`.

### Q: What if I accidentally commit `.env.local` in the future?
**A:** The pre-commit hook will block it. But if it gets through:
1. Don't push to remote
2. Run: `git reset HEAD .env.local`
3. Rotate all keys immediately
4. Remove from Git history if already pushed

### Q: How do I set up environment variables for production?
**A:** See `.claude/docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` → "Environment Separation" → "Setting up Production Environment Variables"
