## üìê Technical Details

### New Features Added:
1. **State management** for collapsed sections
2. **Time calculation functions** (getTimeAgo, getEstimatedTime)
3. **Increased data limits** (20 queries instead of 10)
4. **More icons** (Package, DollarSign, Sparkles, RefreshCw)

### CSS Classes Used:
- `card-elevated` - For important cards with shadows
- `shadow-glow` - For glowing effects on CTAs

- Loaders: `animate-spin` (standard rotation)
- Pulse dots: `animate-pulse` (fading in/out)
- Ping effects: `animate-ping` (expanding circles)
- Arrow rotations: 90¬∞ transform on toggle

## üé¨ Before vs After

### Before:
- Simple cards with basic info
- Plain text timestamps
- No collapsing
- No summary stats
- Basic hover states
- Limited visual hierarchy

### After:
- Rich cards with gradients and icons
- Human-readable time formats
- Collapsible sections for better space management
- Comprehensive stats dashboard
- Multiple layers of hover feedback
- Clear visual hierarchy with size, color, and spacing

## üì± Mobile Considerations

- **Touch-friendly targets** (minimum 44x44px)
- **Readable text sizes** (never smaller than 12px)
- **No hover-only interactions** (all have click equivalents)
- **Flexible layouts** that wrap gracefully
- **Icons supplement text** for easier comprehension

## üîÆ Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Product count badges** on completed searches
2. **Search duration timers** (how long each search took)
3. **Progress percentages** instead of indeterminate bars
4. **Cancel button** for active searches
5. **Quick preview** of results on hover
6. **Search history trends** (graph over time)
