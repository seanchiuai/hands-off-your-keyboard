# Tool Feedback: Pipecat & Gemini

This document provides feedback on our experiences using Pipecat AI and Google Gemini in building the AI Voice Shopping Assistant. We hope this information helps the maintainers and community improve these excellent tools.

## Pipecat AI Framework

**Version Used**: `pipecat-ai[google,webrtc]>=0.0.40`

### What Worked Well ✅

#### 1. **Pipeline Architecture**
The modular pipeline design is excellent. Being able to compose VAD → STT → LLM → TTS → Transport in a clear, linear fashion made the code very maintainable and easy to understand.

```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    vad,
    sentence_aggregator,
    llm_service,
    llm_aggregator,
    tts_service,
])
```

This composition pattern is intuitive for developers coming from streaming/reactive programming backgrounds.

#### 2. **Google Integration**
The `GoogleLLMService` and `GoogleTTSService` integrations worked smoothly out of the box:
- Easy API key configuration
- Straightforward model selection (`gemini-1.5-flash`)
- Voice selection for TTS was simple (`en-US-Neural2-F`)

#### 3. **Custom Function Registration**
The ability to register custom functions that the LLM can invoke is a killer feature:

```python
llm_service.register_function("search_products",
    lambda args: self.actions.search_products(session_id, user_id, **args))
```

This enabled our product search and item saving functionality seamlessly.

#### 4. **Documentation**
The official documentation and examples provided a good starting point for understanding the framework's capabilities.

### Challenges & Improvement Suggestions 🔧

#### 1. **WebSocket Session Management**
**Issue**: Managing multiple concurrent WebSocket sessions required custom implementation.

**Current Approach**:
```python
async def handle_session(self, websocket, path):
    session_id = f"session_{asyncio.get_event_loop().time()}"
    # Custom session management needed
```

**Suggestion**: 
- Provide a built-in session manager class
- Include examples for multi-tenant scenarios
- Add helpers for extracting session metadata from WebSocket connections

#### 2. **Error Handling & Recovery**
**Issue**: When the LLM or TTS service encounters an error, the entire pipeline can stall without clear error propagation.

**Observed Behavior**:
- Network timeouts don't always trigger graceful degradation
- Client doesn't always receive error notifications

**Suggestion**:
- Add built-in error boundaries for each pipeline stage
- Provide hooks for custom error handlers
- Include retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Better logging at each pipeline stage

**Desired API**:
```python
pipeline = Pipeline([...], 
    error_handler=custom_error_handler,
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3, backoff=exponential)
)
```

#### 3. **Context Management in LLM Service**
**Issue**: Setting and updating conversation context requires manual management:

```python
await llm_service.set_context({
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    ],
    "tools": self.actions.get_tool_definitions(),
})
```

**Suggestion**:
- Provide a `ConversationManager` class to handle context windows
- Automatic message history truncation when approaching token limits
- Built-in support for conversation summarization
- Helper methods for appending to context without replacing entire history

#### 4. **Audio Transport Abstraction**
**Issue**: Switching between WebSocket and WebRTC transports requires significant code changes.

**Suggestion**:
- Create a unified transport interface
- Provide easy configuration-based transport selection
- Include examples for both transports with the same application logic

#### 5. **Streaming Response Visibility**
**Issue**: Difficult to access intermediate streaming responses for UI updates (e.g., showing "thinking..." states).

**Suggestion**:
- Add callbacks or event emitters for pipeline stages
- Expose streaming chunks before aggregation
- Provide hooks for progress indicators

**Desired API**:
```python
pipeline.on_stage_start("llm", lambda: ui.show_thinking())
pipeline.on_stage_complete("llm", lambda: ui.hide_thinking())
```

#### 6. **Debugging & Observability**
**Issue**: When voice doesn't work end-to-end, it's challenging to pinpoint which stage failed.

**Suggestion**:
- Add a debug mode with verbose logging at each stage
- Provide pipeline visualization tools
- Include audio/transcript inspection utilities
- Built-in metrics collection (latency per stage, token usage, etc.)

**Example Debug Output Needed**:
```
[VAD] Audio detected: duration=2.3s
[STT] Transcribed: "I need a laptop"
[LLM] Tokens: 15 input, 87 output, latency=234ms
[TTS] Generated: 3.2s audio, latency=156ms
[Transport] Sent: 128KB audio data
```

#### 7. **Voice Activity Detection Tuning**
**Issue**: Silero VAD sensitivity is not easily configurable, leading to:
- False positives (background noise triggering speech detection)
- False negatives (quiet speech not detected)

**Suggestion**:
- Expose VAD sensitivity parameters
- Provide environment-specific presets (quiet room, noisy office, etc.)
- Add calibration utilities

## Google Gemini API

**Model Used**: 
- `gemini-1.5-flash` (voice conversations)
- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (preference learning)

### What Worked Well ✅

#### 1. **Function Calling**
Gemini's function calling is robust and well-designed:

```javascript
const result = await generateObject({
  model: google("gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
  schema: z.object({...}),
  prompt: context,
});
```

The structured output with Zod schemas works flawlessly for preference extraction.

#### 2. **Conversational Quality**
For shopping assistance, Gemini produces natural, helpful responses:
- Understands context well
- Asks relevant clarifying questions
- Maintains conversation flow

#### 3. **Structured Output (Gemini 2.0)**
The `generateObject` API with Zod schemas for preference extraction is exceptional:
- Type-safe output

### Challenges & Improvement Suggestions 🔧

#### 1. **Function Calling Parameter Extraction**
**Issue**: Sometimes Gemini doesn't extract all available parameters from user queries.

**Example**:
- User: "Find me a gaming laptop under $1500"
- Expected: `{query: "gaming laptop", max_price: 1500}`
- Actual: `{query: "gaming laptop under $1500"}` (price not extracted as parameter)

**Suggestion**:
- Improve parameter extraction from natural language
- Provide better examples in function descriptions
- Add parameter suggestion hints in responses

#### 2. **Token Usage Visibility**
**Issue**: When using `@ai-sdk/google`, token usage isn't easily accessible for monitoring.

**Current Workaround**: Manual tracking needed

**Suggestion**:
- Include token counts in response metadata
- Provide usage statistics endpoints
- Add billing estimation helpers

#### 3. **Streaming Function Calls**
**Issue**: Function calls happen only after the full response is generated, not during streaming.

**Impact**: User waits for entire LLM response before product search begins

**Suggestion**:
- Support streaming function call detection
- Allow function execution as soon as parameters are available
- Parallel function execution with response generation

#### 4. **Context Window Management**
**Issue**: No built-in tools for managing long conversations that approach token limits.

**Current Approach**: Manual truncation and summarization

**Suggestion**:
- Automatic conversation summarization when approaching limits
- Sliding window strategies
- Important message preservation

#### 5. **Multi-Turn Function Calling**
**Issue**: When a function call result should trigger another function call, it requires multiple round trips.

**Example Scenario**:
1. User: "Show me laptops and save the Dell one"
2. Needs: `search_products()` → get results → identify Dell → `save_item()`

**Current**: Requires 2-3 conversation turns

**Suggestion**:
- Support chained function calls in single turn
- Allow function results to trigger follow-up functions
- Provide "action plan" mode for complex queries

---
