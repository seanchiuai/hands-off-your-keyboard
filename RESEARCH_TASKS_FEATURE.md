# Deep Research Visibility in Tasks - Feature Documentation

## Overview
Added a real-time research task panel to the Tasks page, allowing users to see all their deep research queries and their current status at a glance.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ResearchTasksPanel Component
**Location**: `components/ResearchTasksPanel.tsx`

A comprehensive panel that displays:
- **Active Searches**: Live queries that are currently pending or searching
  - Animated spinner for searching state
  - Clock icon for pending state
  - Progress bar with indeterminate animation
  - Shows search query text and filters (price range)
  - Real-time status updates
  
- **Recently Completed**: Last 3 completed searches
  - Clickable cards that navigate to results
  - Shows completion time
  - Hover effect with arrow indicator
  
- **Failed Searches**: Last 2 failed queries
  - Shows failure time
  - "Try again" link to research page
  - Visual warning indicators

- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no research tasks exist
  - Call-to-action button to start research

### 2. Integration with TodoDashboard
**Location**: `components/TodoDashboard.tsx`

- Added ResearchTasksPanel at the top of the tasks page
- Section header: "üî¨ Deep Research" with subtitle "Live product searches"
- Visual separator between research tasks and regular todos
- Increased max-width to accommodate both sections

### 3. URL Navigation Support
**Location**: `app/research/page.tsx`

- Added `useSearchParams` hook to read query parameters
- Automatically opens results tab when `queryId` is in URL
- Allows direct linking to specific research results
- Example: `/research?queryId=abc123` opens that query's results

### 4. CSS Animations
**Location**: `app/globals.css`

Added progress bar animation:
```css
@keyframes progress-indeterminate {
  0% { transform: translateX(-100%); }
  100% { transform: translateX(400%); }
}
```

This creates a smooth, continuous loading indicator for active searches.

## User Experience

### Status Indicators
- üïê **Pending**: Clock icon with "Starting..." badge
- üîÑ **Searching**: Spinning loader with "Searching..." badge
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Green checkmark, clickable to view results
- ‚ùå **Failed**: Red X with error badge

### Real-time Updates
- Status changes are reflected instantly via Convex real-time queries
- Progress bars animate smoothly during searches
- New searches appear immediately in the active section

### Navigation Flow
1. User starts a search in Research page
2. Search appears in Tasks page under "Active Searches"
3. User can monitor progress from Tasks page
4. When complete, it moves to "Recently Completed"
5. Click to view full results

## Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Active**: Blue theme (`border-blue-500`, `bg-blue-50/5`)
- **Completed**: Green checkmark with hover effects
- **Failed**: Red theme (`border-red-500`, `bg-red-50/5`)

### Card Styles
- Elevated cards for active searches (more prominent)
- Simple cards for completed items (hover to highlight)
- Border-left accent for status indication
- Consistent padding and spacing

### Typography
- Section headers: Uppercase, small, semibold with emoji
- Query titles: Truncated with ellipsis if too long
- Timestamps: Small, muted text
- Badges: Bold, colored backgrounds

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Research queries stored in Convex `queries` table
2. `getUserQueries` query fetches recent queries (limit: 10)
3. Queries filtered by status client-side:
   - Active: `pending` or `searching`
   - Completed: `completed` (limit 3 shown)
   - Failed: `failed` (limit 2 shown)
4. Real-time updates via Convex subscription

### Performance
- Component renders only when data changes
- Efficient filtering on already-fetched data
- Skeleton loading state while data fetches
- No unnecessary re-renders

### Accessibility
- Clickable cards have hover states
- Icons provide visual status indicators
- Text descriptions for all states
- Keyboard navigation supported (inherited from framework)

## Files Modified

1. **New Files**:
   - `components/ResearchTasksPanel.tsx` (259 lines)
   - `RESEARCH_TASKS_FEATURE.md` (this file)

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `components/TodoDashboard.tsx` - Added ResearchTasksPanel integration
   - `app/research/page.tsx` - Added URL parameter support
   - `app/globals.css` - Added progress bar animation

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start a new search in Research page
- [ ] Navigate to Tasks page
- [ ] Verify search appears in "Active Searches" section
- [ ] Verify animated progress bar is visible
- [ ] Wait for search to complete
- [ ] Verify it moves to "Recently Completed"
- [ ] Click on completed search
- [ ] Verify navigation to results page with correct query
- [ ] Test with no searches (empty state)
- [ ] Test with failed search
- [ ] Verify real-time updates (open two tabs)

### Edge Cases Handled
- No research queries exist (empty state)
- Multiple active searches (all shown)
- Very long query names (truncated with ellipsis)
- Failed searches (distinct styling and retry link)
- URL with invalid queryId (gracefully ignored)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add search duration timer
2. Show estimated time remaining for active searches
3. Add ability to cancel searches from Tasks page
4. Show product count for completed searches
5. Add filter/sort options for research history
6. Add pagination for many searches
7. Show preview thumbnails of products found
8. Add "Retry" button for failed searches directly in Tasks
9. Export/share research results
10. Add notifications when searches complete

## Benefits

### For Users
- ‚úÖ **Visibility**: See all research activity in one place
- ‚úÖ **Convenience**: Monitor searches without leaving Tasks page
- ‚úÖ **Quick Access**: Jump to results with one click
- ‚úÖ **Status Clarity**: Clear visual indicators for each state
- ‚úÖ **Context**: See search parameters at a glance

### For Development
- ‚úÖ **Reusability**: Component can be used elsewhere
